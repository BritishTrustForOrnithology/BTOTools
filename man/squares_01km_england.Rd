List of 1-km squares with land in England (see also lists for other countries. 
A square is listed for a country if it contains any land. Therefore, individual 
squares can be present in more than one list if they fall on a country border. 
Lists are based on low tide shapefiles so include some sand flats. Includes 
Isle of Man but not Channel Islands.
